TypeScript
- Programming language made by microsoft to improve JS short comings
- Built on top of JS file
- JS with Type Checking
- Code passes at compiler and errors are caught
- Prevents errors at runtime, less need for unit test


Benefits
- Static Typing --> knowing the type of variable at declaration
- Code Completion
- Refactoring
- Shorthand Notation
- Best for medium to large projects

*Dynamic Typing is variable being determined at runtime --> Can lead to errors due to type errors --> Example: Using a math method on a string

Drawbacks
- Compliation --> compliation step so browser can understand the code --> Transpilation
- Discipline in Coding

Transpilation
- Process of compiling TypeScript
- .ts file --> runs through compiler --> creates a js file

Setting up the Dev environment
- Node.js --> shell --> npm i -g typescript --> installs typescript --> tsc -v --> shows the version of typescript
- every typescript file ends with .ts
- tsc fileName in terminal to compile
- tsc --init --> creates a config file
    Target
        - changes JS type --> es5, es6, 2016 -->2016 is safe for most browsers
    Module
        - rootDir --> changes root directory --> good practices is to use a source folder
    Emit
        -outDir --> sets compiled js file locations
        -removeComments --> removes comments from ts file --> generated JS file shorter
        -noEmitOnError --> if error, no Js file is compiled --> always have this
        -sourceMap --> Enables debugging --> how each line in ts file maps to js
    Type Checking
        -noUnusedParameters --> creates errors if unused params in functions
        -noImplicitReturns --> checks to see all code paths return a value
        -noUnusedLocals --> checks for unused variables
- tsc --> without fileName will run now
        
*Note: You may have to update previous packagees if you get error TS2403
1. npm i -g npm-check-updates
2. ncu -u 
3. npm install

Debugging in typescript
- once souce map is enabled go to debug in vscode on sidebar 
- create a launch.json file using node.js
- add "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json" to the launch json file
- shortcut to launch is f5
- shortcut to step over is f10

tsc --> compiles ts to Js
node /filelocation -->execute JS code
